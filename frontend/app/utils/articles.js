  article1: `From welfare to Waffen: Germany’s militarism is just an embarrassing push for relevance
Berlin’s new scheme is expensive, empty, and dangerous
By Timofey Bordachev, Program Director of the Valdai Club

A few days ago, German media reported a historic first: for the first time since the Second World War, Berlin has deployed a permanent military brigade abroad. The 45th Armoured Brigade of the Bundeswehr has been officially stationed near Vilnius, Lithuania. While the true capacity of this unit remains unclear, its symbolic weight is undeniable. Even in a modest form, the move reeks of provocation – a mix of tactical recklessness and strategic naivety.

This is not the result of some grand strategy. Rather, it appears to be the product of political foolishness. Berlin has stepped into a situation that it neither fully understands nor can hope to control. A genuine rearmament of Germany will not be permitted – by its neighbors, the European Union, or the United States. But the illusion of militarization, which is precisely what we are witnessing now, could still cause real-world consequences. Dangerous ones.

Germany, like much of the West, is no longer a source of danger due to strength, but rather due to weakness. It has no vision of the future and remains anchored to the past. Its leaders expend their dwindling energy on extending yesterday’s policies instead of preparing for tomorrow. In this regard, Germany is Western Europe magnified: a state drifting into irrelevance, yet desperate to appear decisive.

The current flirtation with militarization is not driven by security imperatives but by political and economic dysfunction. First, German politicians have discovered a convenient excuse to channel billions in spending under the guise of defense – a trend accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic. Germany, the largest economy in Western Europe, now offers a juicy target for corruption and opportunism.

Second, it is increasingly clear that future generations across most of Europe will be poorer than their parents. Western capitalism is stagnating, and the EU’s economic model is running on fumes. Politicians, unable to deliver prosperity, instead promise security. Unable to admit failure, they invoke external threats – primarily Russia – to justify austerity and redirect public frustration.

American economist Jeffrey Sachs recently noted that those warning of a Russian invasion of Western Europe ought to see a psychiatrist. Yet such voices dominate the media, particularly in Germany, where the specter of the “Eastern threat” is used to stoke fear and justify a new wave of militarization.

The German public is being told that Western Europe must pay for its security, but no one dares to ask: security from what? The answer, of course, lies in the wallets of German and American defense contractors, media mouthpieces, and the NGO-industrial complex.

Meanwhile, Germany’s own economy is stalling. Historically the biggest beneficiary of the EU, Berlin now finds itself reluctant to share resources with poorer member states. By invoking a military emergency, Berlin creates an excuse to hoard its wealth, keeping funds at home rather than funneling them via trade and structural funds to struggling partners in the south and east.

Some analysts even suggest German leaders are actively preparing the public for war with Russia. The evidence? A growing hysteria in political discourse and increasingly bizarre decisions. Of course, it’s worth remembering that Germany’s political class has long functioned under the watchful eye of Washington. The US does not merely influence Berlin; it effectively micromanages it.

But the real farce lies in the broader Western European reaction. France, Italy, Spain – and even Britain, which is no longer an EU member – have all encouraged Germany’s military revival, albeit for selfish reasons. These countries know that any increase in German defense spending will inevitably weaken Germany in the long term. Paris, for example, need not spend much on defense itself. Even its contributions to Ukraine pale in comparison to other Western countries.

NATO’s role in this is equally cynical. The alliance encourages standardization of weapons, which, in practice, means buying American. The US loves German rearmament because it boosts demand for American arms.

Yet it must be said that nothing happening today compares to the militarization of Germany in the 1930s. Back then, the state had collapsed, the streets were filled with destitute war veterans, and radical ideologies thrived. Today’s militarism is more theatrical than dangerous – but theatrics can still spiral.

One area of real concern is the Baltic States. Should the US reduce its presence, reckless decisions by local governments in Latvia, Lithuania, or Estonia could easily drag Germany into a conflict it neither started nor wants. German troops stationed in Vilnius may soon find themselves hostages to local provocation.

Berlin has no capacity to assess or react to such risks. Decades of dependency on US guidance have dulled German strategic thinking. What remains is a kind of frivolous militarism – an expensive charade with no serious intentions, but many potential side effects.

This behavior is not born of confidence, but of confusion. It is the latest symptom of a region in decline, ruled by elites who are out of ideas and desperate to distract their citizens from the harsh truth: the good times are over, and they have no plan for what comes next.

In the meantime, the illusion of a military revival continues – and it may take only one misstep to turn illusion into catastrophe.`,
  article2: `Trump admin asking federal agencies to cancel remaining Harvard contracts

The Trump administration is asking all federal agencies to find ways to terminate all federal contracts with Harvard University amid an ongoing standoff over foreign students’ records at the Ivy League school. The General Services Administration is planning to send a letter Tuesday instructing all federal agencies to review the estimated $100 million remaining in federal contracts with Harvard and potentially find alternative vendors, according to a copy of the letter obtained by Fox News.

The remaining federal contracts include a $527,000 agreement for Harvard ManageMentor Licenses, which was awarded in September 2021; a $523,000 contract for Harvard to conduct research on energy drinks and the health outcomes of other dietary intakes over time, awarded in August 2023; and a $39,000 contract for graduate student research services, awarded in April 2025, a source familiar with the matter told Fox News.

In the letter, GSA’s Federal Acquisition Service Commissioner Josh Gruenbaum said Harvard “continues to engage in race discrimination, including in its admissions process and in other areas of student life.” He added that Harvard has shown “no indication” of reforming its admissions process, despite the Supreme Court ruling that the university’s long-standing policy discriminates on the basis of race. For applicants in the top academic decile, admissions rates were 56 percent for African-Americans, 31 percent for Hispanics, 15 percent for Whites and 13 percent for Asians, according to the lawsuit. Gruenbaum noted that Harvard “now has to offer a remedial math course, which has been described as ‘middle school math’ for incoming freshmen,” a direct result, he said, “of employing discriminatory factors, instead of merit, in admission decisions.”

Gruenbaum also cited possible violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 regarding Harvard’s hiring, promotion, compensation and other personnel-related actions. He said discriminatory practices “have been exposed at the Harvard Law Review, where internal documents that have been made public detail the pervasive and explicit racial discrimination in the publication’s article selection and editor appointment process.”

“GSA is also aware of recent events at Harvard University involving anti-Semitic action that suggest the institution has a disturbing lack of concern for the safety and wellbeing of Jewish students,” Gruenbaum wrote. “Harvard’s ongoing inaction in the face of repeated and severe harassment and targeting of its students has at times grounded day-to-day campus operations to a halt, deprived Jewish students of learning and research opportunities to which they are entitled, and profoundly alarmed the general public.”

Fox News Digital reached out to Harvard University for comment Tuesday.

Harvard has already sued in federal court seeking the restoration of about $3.2 billion in federal grant funding frozen by the administration since last month. In a separate suit, the university was granted a temporary restraining order on Friday blocking the government from canceling the school’s certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, which permits Harvard to host international students with F-1 or J-1 visas. Harvard said the revocation would impact more than 7,000 visa holders—more than a quarter of its student body.

A brief federal court hearing was held Tuesday morning in Boston to address the matter. A judge scheduled another hearing for Thursday to allow both parties more time to present their cases.

President Donald Trump said in a TRUTH Social post on Monday that he is “considering taking Three Billion Dollars of Grant Money away from a very antisemitic Harvard, and giving it to TRADE SCHOOLS all across our land.” “What a great investment that would be for the USA, and so badly needed!!!” he wrote.

The president also accused Harvard of being “very slow” in handing over documents about foreign students and of having “shopped around and found the absolute best judge (for them).”

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said last week that she revoked Harvard’s certification after the university refused to comply with multiple requests for information on foreign students while “perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, and employs racist ‘diversity, equity and inclusion’ policies.”

The requested records include any and all audio or video footage in Harvard’s possession regarding threats to other students or university personnel; deprivation of rights of classmates or personnel; and dangerous or violent activity, whether on or off campus, by a nonimmigrant student enrolled at Harvard in the last five years. Noem is also asking for any and all disciplinary records and audio or video footage of protest activity involving nonimmigrant students. DHS said Harvard’s responses so far have been insufficient.`,
  article3: `The EU’s migration policies and the end of human rights in Europe

In January, Greek Prime Minister Kiriakos Mitsotakis featured prominently at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Among the various topics, he was asked to comment on was migration. “Greece has probably managed the migration problem better than most other European countries,” he said confidently in an interview with CNN’s Richard Quest on the sidelines of the forum. “We won a resounding victory [in the elections] partly because we succeeded in managing the migration through a tough but fair migration policy.”

But this “tough but fair migration policy” resulted in the death of more than 500 people, including 100 children, in a single incident of a migrant boat sinking off the Greek coast near Pylos on June 14. The Greek coastguard has been accused of causing what is considered one of the worst maritime disasters in the Mediterranean by attempting to tow the boat to Italian territorial waters.

The Greek authorities have denied responsibility and instead arrested nine of the survivors, blaming them for causing the shipwreck. As Mitsotakis headed for Davos, the investigation was closed and handed to the prosecution, after requests by the survivors’ lawyers to consider important evidence in their defence were rejected.

The injustice and shocking disregard for human life in this story are not an aberration, but the culmination of a policy of systematic denial of protection and violation of the rights of refugees. And they are also reflected in the new migration pact the European Union has just concluded.

The tragic stories of death at European borders and the lack of action on them indicate the direction in which Europe is headed, united under a far-right “law and order” flag and racist anti-migrant policies. It is towards a dark future in which human rights will could come to an end.

A racist EU migration pact

The issue of migration has always been a useful political tool and one of the cornerstones of the far right in Europe. But in the past decade, the rest of the political spectrum has also increasingly instrumentalised and gradually adopted it in a desperate attempt to improve declining electoral fortunes. As a result, European migration policies have taken a sharp turn to the right, reflecting more and more closely the far right’s racist agenda and a rhetoric of exclusion of non-Europeans.

The new “Migration Pact” of the EU is a case in point. The European Parliament and the European Council reached a provisional agreement on it five days before Christmas. Roberta Metsola, the president of the European Parliament, called it a “historic day”; human rights organisations called it a “disaster”. On February 8, EU member states approved it, and it is now pending final formal endorsement by the EU Parliament and the European Council.

The regulations that the pact will introduce will cover all stages of the asylum process: from screening asylum seekers upon arrival and collection of biometric data to rules for determining which member state is responsible for handling their applications. The provisions, which are meant to “fundamentally change how we deal with migration and asylum”, however, contain numerous gaps which allow for abuse and further strengthening of violent policies at EU borders.

Rights organisations have pointed out that the pact can usher in the detention of asylum seekers, including families with children, in prison-like facilities; lead to more violence by border authorities; and allow deportation to unsafe third countries.

It will not provide a safe and dignified path to the asylum-seeking procedure that could save lives and it will not prevent tragedies like the Pylos shipwreck from repeating. Instead, as Amnesty International notes, the new pact will result in “a surge in suffering on every step of a person’s journey to seek asylum” in Europe.

Additionally, countries like Poland and Hungary have rejected the relocation mechanism, under which they would have to accept refugees. The pact gives them the alternative option to pay 20,000 euros ($21,550) per refugee; in other words, they can pay their way out of their obligations under European and international law.

This means not only that there will be an even heavier burden put on countries at the EU’s external borders, but that basic legal norms on the protection of refugees are being eroded.

A dark future for Fortress Europe

Overall, the migration pact reflects a tendency within the EU to shrink the scope of international law to the point where it becomes irrelevant to those whom it was created to protect.

Failing to put in place a common European asylum system with clear rules and regulations, not lifting the pressure from entrance countries, further militarising border control, and outsourcing the problem of migration to third countries reflect the EU’s continuing effort to dodge its obligations under international law towards asylum seekers.

The long-term effect of ignoring and downplaying international legal norms is the potential collapse of the global international system, which would mean the end of the human rights regime as we know it.

Another disturbing aspect of Europe’s migration pact asylum policy is that it discriminates between people seeking asylum. The EU announced that its provisions will not apply to Ukrainian refugees. In other words, Brussels officially applies international law selectively; it openly declares that people of a certain race are deserving of a pathway to safety and others are not.

This is all the more egregious considering that the migration pact is meant to keep away people fleeing conflict and other crises in Africa and the Middle East, which European countries are often directly involved in.

By clearly and formally discriminating between who is deserving of a safe and legal route of asylum-seeking and migration and who is not, the EU is setting a dangerous precedent. Discrimination over the right to request protection under international law and the allocation of different rights for different groups opens the door to legal apartheid.

It appears the EU has appointed itself as the arbiter of who has the right to life and dignity and who does not. This is apparent in its reaction to the war in Gaza as well.

Europe has turned a blind eye to the accusations of genocide in Gaza, as European countries continue selling weapons to Israel and parroting its outrageous argument about “its right to self-defence” from a population it occupies.

It is important to note here that among the most fervent pro-Israeli forces in Europe is the far right which is using the war in Gaza to push its agenda, promote ideas of cultural war, and whitewash its anti-Semitism.

Support for the far right is surging in Europe and that is not because of “illegal migration” as some EU officials, like Ylva Johansson, commissioner for home affairs, have claimed. It is because European “centrist conservatives”, like Mitsotakis, have embraced the far right’s agenda for their own narrow political and economic interests.

This will certainly be reflected in the upcoming European parliamentary elections scheduled for June.

If there is no profound overhaul of the antihuman and inhumane direction European politics and policies are taking, the future of the EU looks very dark. As it stands now, we are on a straight path towards a Europe where the Viktor Orbáns, Geert Wilderss and Marine Le Pens will have a much stronger say about what is on the agenda and what is not.`
