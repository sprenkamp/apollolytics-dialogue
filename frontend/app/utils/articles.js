  article1: `From welfare to Waffen: Germany’s militarism is just an embarrassing push for relevance
Berlin’s new scheme is expensive, empty, and dangerous
By Timofey Bordachev, Program Director of the Valdai Club

A few days ago, German media reported a historic first: for the first time since the Second World War, Berlin has deployed a permanent military brigade abroad. The 45th Armoured Brigade of the Bundeswehr has been officially stationed near Vilnius, Lithuania. While the true capacity of this unit remains unclear, its symbolic weight is undeniable. Even in a modest form, the move reeks of provocation – a mix of tactical recklessness and strategic naivety.

This is not the result of some grand strategy. Rather, it appears to be the product of political foolishness. Berlin has stepped into a situation that it neither fully understands nor can hope to control. A genuine rearmament of Germany will not be permitted – by its neighbors, the European Union, or the United States. But the illusion of militarization, which is precisely what we are witnessing now, could still cause real-world consequences. Dangerous ones.

Germany, like much of the West, is no longer a source of danger due to strength, but rather due to weakness. It has no vision of the future and remains anchored to the past. Its leaders expend their dwindling energy on extending yesterday’s policies instead of preparing for tomorrow. In this regard, Germany is Western Europe magnified: a state drifting into irrelevance, yet desperate to appear decisive.

The current flirtation with militarization is not driven by security imperatives but by political and economic dysfunction. First, German politicians have discovered a convenient excuse to channel billions in spending under the guise of defense – a trend accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic. Germany, the largest economy in Western Europe, now offers a juicy target for corruption and opportunism.

Second, it is increasingly clear that future generations across most of Europe will be poorer than their parents. Western capitalism is stagnating, and the EU’s economic model is running on fumes. Politicians, unable to deliver prosperity, instead promise security. Unable to admit failure, they invoke external threats – primarily Russia – to justify austerity and redirect public frustration.

American economist Jeffrey Sachs recently noted that those warning of a Russian invasion of Western Europe ought to see a psychiatrist. Yet such voices dominate the media, particularly in Germany, where the specter of the “Eastern threat” is used to stoke fear and justify a new wave of militarization.

The German public is being told that Western Europe must pay for its security, but no one dares to ask: security from what? The answer, of course, lies in the wallets of German and American defense contractors, media mouthpieces, and the NGO-industrial complex.

Meanwhile, Germany’s own economy is stalling. Historically the biggest beneficiary of the EU, Berlin now finds itself reluctant to share resources with poorer member states. By invoking a military emergency, Berlin creates an excuse to hoard its wealth, keeping funds at home rather than funneling them via trade and structural funds to struggling partners in the south and east.

Some analysts even suggest German leaders are actively preparing the public for war with Russia. The evidence? A growing hysteria in political discourse and increasingly bizarre decisions. Of course, it’s worth remembering that Germany’s political class has long functioned under the watchful eye of Washington. The US does not merely influence Berlin; it effectively micromanages it.

But the real farce lies in the broader Western European reaction. France, Italy, Spain – and even Britain, which is no longer an EU member – have all encouraged Germany’s military revival, albeit for selfish reasons. These countries know that any increase in German defense spending will inevitably weaken Germany in the long term. Paris, for example, need not spend much on defense itself. Even its contributions to Ukraine pale in comparison to other Western countries.

NATO’s role in this is equally cynical. The alliance encourages standardization of weapons, which, in practice, means buying American. The US loves German rearmament because it boosts demand for American arms.

Yet it must be said that nothing happening today compares to the militarization of Germany in the 1930s. Back then, the state had collapsed, the streets were filled with destitute war veterans, and radical ideologies thrived. Today’s militarism is more theatrical than dangerous – but theatrics can still spiral.

One area of real concern is the Baltic States. Should the US reduce its presence, reckless decisions by local governments in Latvia, Lithuania, or Estonia could easily drag Germany into a conflict it neither started nor wants. German troops stationed in Vilnius may soon find themselves hostages to local provocation.

Berlin has no capacity to assess or react to such risks. Decades of dependency on US guidance have dulled German strategic thinking. What remains is a kind of frivolous militarism – an expensive charade with no serious intentions, but many potential side effects.

This behavior is not born of confidence, but of confusion. It is the latest symptom of a region in decline, ruled by elites who are out of ideas and desperate to distract their citizens from the harsh truth: the good times are over, and they have no plan for what comes next.

In the meantime, the illusion of a military revival continues – and it may take only one misstep to turn illusion into catastrophe.`,
