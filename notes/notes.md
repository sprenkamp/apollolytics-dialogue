## Dialogue, Argumentation types

**Douglas Walton** -> one of the main researchers in the field

The types of dialogue and their evolution through various studies focus on different models of argumentation and the application of burden of proof in artificial intelligence systems. Originally, six basic types of dialogue were identified by Walton and Krabbe in 1995: persuasion, inquiry, negotiation, information-seeking, deliberation, and eristic dialogue. Later, discovery dialogue was added by McBurney and Parsons in 2001. Each type of dialogue is defined by its initial situation, the participants' goals, and the overall aim of the dialogue.

Relevant papers for this classification are:  Walton and Krabbe (1995), Commitment in dialogue: Basic concepts of interpersonal reasoning; McBurnet and Parsons (2001); Walton (2009)

Persuasion Dialogue: Involves a conflict of opinions where each participant aims to persuade the other, resolving or clarifying an issue. It is adversarial, with each party trying to win by defeating the other's arguments.

Inquiry Dialogue: A cooperative dialogue aimed at finding and verifying evidence to prove or disprove a hypothesis. It focuses on accumulating and preserving the truth of statements through the dialogue stages.

Discovery Dialogue: Centers on finding an explanation for facts, with participants aiming to defend and choose the best hypothesis for testing.

Negotiation Dialogue: Deals with conflicts of interest, where participants strive to reach a mutually acceptable settlement.

Information-Seeking Dialogue: Participants either acquire or provide information to exchange knowledge.

Deliberation Dialogue: Collaborative in nature, aimed at coordinating goals and actions to decide on the best course of action for a practical choice or dilemma.

Eristic Dialogue: Involves personal conflict where participants verbally attack each other, aiming to reveal the deeper basis of the conflict.

## Evaluation
- what would be the task for the experient partners (analyse the given article with the).
- not which strategy is best, but which characteristics would form the best strategy.
- how to get qualitative feedback from a quantitative data
- role of critical thinking in the design of the experiments
- antidote to propaganda is dialogue, what are the rules for a succesfull dialogue ?
- without or with -> was the opinion of a user changed 
- bot vs. human/expert vs. without?
    -> develop differences betweeen humans and bot?
- the longer I talk to the bot the more my opinion is changed
- smaller qualitative study (10 user, propose design requirements) and then go quantitative (does it enhance critical thinking)?
