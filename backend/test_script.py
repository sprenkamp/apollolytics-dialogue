    "article1": """From welfare to Waffen: Germany's militarism is just an embarrassing push for relevance
Berlin's new scheme is expensive, empty, and dangerous
By Timofey Bordachev, Program Director of the Valdai Club

A few days ago, German media reported a historic first: for the first time since the Second World War, Berlin has deployed a permanent military brigade abroad. The 45th Armoured Brigade of the Bundeswehr has been officially stationed near Vilnius, Lithuania. While the true capacity of this unit remains unclear, its symbolic weight is undeniable. Even in a modest form, the move reeks of provocation â€“ a mix of tactical recklessness and strategic naivety.""",
    
    "article2": """Trump admin asking federal agencies to cancel remaining Harvard contracts

The Trump administration is asking all federal agencies to find ways to terminate all federal contracts with Harvard University amid an ongoing standoff over foreign students' records at the Ivy League school.""",
