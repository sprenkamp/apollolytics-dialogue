The boat, carrying hundreds of migrants, was reportedly being towed by the Greek coastguard when it capsized, leading to a significant loss of life. Survivors and human rights groups have accused the Greek coastguard of causing the disaster by attempting to tow the boat to Italian waters, which allegedly led to the capsizing. The Greek coastguard has faced legal charges and criticism for their handling of the situation, with accusations of negligence and failure to conduct timely rescue operations [1], [3], [4], [6].\n\n- **Warning:** The statement may be misleading if it implies that the Greek coastguard's actions were solely responsible for the disaster without considering other factors such as the condition of the boat, the number of people on board, and the broader context of migration policies in the Mediterranean. It is important to note that investigations are ongoing, and legal proceedings have been initiated against members of the coastguard. The situation is complex, involving multiple parties and international maritime laws [2], [3], [5].\n\n- **Sources:** \n  - [1](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-06-30/survivors-of-the-shipwreck-in-the-mediterranean-accuse-greek-authorities-the-coast-guard-towed-us-at-high-speed-and-we-capsized.html) Survivors of the shipwreck in the Mediterranean accuse Greek coastguard (2023-Jun)\n  - [2](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8yjlzd3pvo) Greek coastguards charged over 2023 migrant shipwreck (NO DATE)\n  - [3](https://www.amnesty.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/12dec-Embargoed-AI-HRW-Pylos-Briefing-EUR2575182023eng.pdf) GREECE: 6 MONTHS ON, NO JUSTICE FOR PYLOS SHIPWRECK (NO DATE)\n  - [4](https://forensic-architecture.org/investigation/the-pylos-shipwreck) The Pylos Shipwreck \u2190 Forensic Architecture (NO DATE)\n  - [6](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/12/14/greece-6-months-no-justice-pylos-shipwreck) Greece: 6 Months On, No Justice for Pylos Shipwreck | Human (2023-Dec)"

The Mediterranean Sea remains one of the deadliest routes, with high death rates among migrants [1], [2], [3]. European policies have been criticized for externalizing border control to non-EU countries, which can lead to human rights abuses and increased risks for migrants [4], [6].

The EU's new Pact on Migration and Asylum has been criticized for potentially curtailing the rights of migrants and asylum seekers, reflecting a more exclusionary approach [1], [2], [3], [4], [5].\n- **Warning:** The statement that European migration policies are aligning with a \"far right\u2019s racist agenda\" may be misleading if it implies that all policy changes are driven by racism.

While right-wing populism is gaining ground, it faces significant challenges, including internal divisions and legal setbacks, as seen with Marine Le Pen's conviction [4].
