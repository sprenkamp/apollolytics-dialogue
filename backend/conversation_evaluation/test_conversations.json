The 45th Armoured Brigade of the Bundeswehr has been officially stationed near Vilnius, Lithuania. While the true capacity of this unit remains unclear, its symbolic weight is undeniable. Even in a modest form, the move reeks of provocation – a mix of tactical recklessness and strategic naivety.\n\nThis is not the result of some grand strategy. Rather, it appears to be the product of political foolishness. Berlin has stepped into a situation that it neither fully understands nor can hope to control. A genuine rearmament of Germany will not be permitted – by its neighbors, the European Union, or the United States. But the illusion of militarization, which is precisely what we are witnessing now, could still cause real-world consequences. Dangerous ones.\n\nGermany, like much of the West, is no longer a source of danger due to strength, but rather due to weakness. It has no vision of the future and remains anchored to the past. Its leaders expend their dwindling energy on extending yesterday's policies instead of preparing for tomorrow. In this regard, Germany is Western Europe magnified: a state drifting into irrelevance, yet desperate to appear decisive.\n\nThe current flirtation with militarization is not driven by security imperatives but by political and economic dysfunction. First, German politicians have discovered a convenient excuse to channel billions in spending under the guise of defense – a trend accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic. Germany, the largest economy in Western Europe, now offers a juicy target for corruption and opportunism.\n\nSecond, it is increasingly clear that future generations across most of Europe will be poorer than their parents. Western capitalism is stagnating, and the EU's economic model is running on fumes. Politicians, unable to deliver prosperity, instead promise security. Unable to admit failure, they invoke external threats – primarily Russia – to justify austerity and redirect public frustration.\n\nAmerican economist Jeffrey Sachs recently noted that those warning of a Russian invasion of Western Europe ought to see a psychiatrist. Yet such voices dominate the media, particularly in Germany, where the specter of the \"Eastern threat\" is used to stoke fear and justify a new wave of militarization.\n\nCombined might of Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill saved the world. Can we repeat the recipe?\nRead more Combined might of Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill saved the world. Can we repeat the recipe?\nThe German public is being told that Western Europe must pay for its security, but no one dares to ask: security from what? The answer, of course, lies in the wallets of German and American defense contractors, media mouthpieces, and the NGO-industrial complex.\n\nMeanwhile, Germany's own economy is stalling. Historically the biggest beneficiary of the EU, Berlin now finds itself reluctant to share resources with poorer member states. By invoking a military emergency, Berlin creates an excuse to hoard its wealth, keeping funds at home rather than funneling them via trade and structural funds to struggling partners in the south and east.\n\nSome analysts even suggest German leaders are actively preparing the public for war with Russia. The evidence? A growing hysteria in political discourse and increasingly bizarre decisions. Of course, it's worth remembering that Germany's political class has long functioned under the watchful eye of Washington. The US does not merely influence Berlin; it effectively micromanages it.\n\nBut the real farce lies in the broader Western European reaction. France, Italy, Spain – and even Britain, which is no longer an EU member – have all encouraged Germany's military revival, albeit for selfish reasons. These countries know that any increase in German defense spending will inevitably weaken Germany in the long term. Paris, for example, need not spend much on defense itself. Even its contributions to Ukraine pale in comparison to other Western countries.\n\nBreaking the ice: How Russia's nuclear fleet outpaces rivals\nRead more Breaking the ice: How Russia's nuclear fleet outpaces rivals\nNATO's role in this is equally cynical. The alliance encourages standardization of weapons, which, in practice, means buying American. The US loves German rearmament because it boosts demand for American arms.\n\nYet it must be said that nothing happening today compares to the militarization of Germany in the 1930s. Back then, the state had collapsed, the streets were filled with destitute war veterans, and radical ideologies thrived. Today's militarism is more theatrical than dangerous – but theatrics can still spiral.\n\nOne area of real concern is the Baltic States. Should the US reduce its presence, reckless decisions by local governments in Latvia, Lithuania, or Estonia could easily drag Germany into a conflict it neither started nor wants. German troops stationed in Vilnius may soon find themselves hostages to local provocation.\n\nBerlin has no capacity to assess or react to such risks. Decades of dependency on US guidance have dulled German strategic thinking. What remains is a kind of frivolous militarism – an expensive charade with no serious intentions, but many potential side effects.\n\nThis behavior is not born of confidence, but of confusion. It is the latest symptom of a region in decline, ruled by elites who are out of ideas and desperate to distract their citizens from the harsh truth: the good times are over, and they have no plan for what comes next.\n\nIn the meantime, the illusion of a military revival continues – and it may take only one misstep to turn illusion into catastrophe.\n\nThis article was first published by 'Vzglyad' newspaper and was translated and edited by the RT team.\n\n**DETECTED PROPAGANDA**: USE THIS INFORMATION TO GUIDE YOUR ARGUMENTATION\n{'Attack on Reputation': [{'explanation': 'The article uses language that questions the competence and strategic understanding of German leaders, portraying them as politically foolish and naive.', 'location': 'This is not the result of some grand strategy.

This trend has been influenced by various factors, including geopolitical tensions and commitments to NATO. The Covid-19 pandemic has had a complex impact on defense budgets. While the pandemic initially strained public finances, it did not significantly halt the upward trend in defense spending. In fact, some countries, including Germany, have used the pandemic as an opportunity to justify increased defense budgets, citing the need for enhanced security and resilience in uncertain times [1], [2], [3].\\n- **Warning:** The statement may be misleading if it suggests that the increase in defense spending is solely or primarily due to the Covid-19 pandemic. While the pandemic has influenced budgetary decisions, other factors such as geopolitical tensions, NATO commitments, and broader security concerns have also played significant roles. It is important to consider these multiple influences rather than attributing the trend to a single cause.\\n- **Sources:** \\n  - [1](https://www.csis.org/analysis/toward-new-lost-decade-covid-19-and-defense-spending-europe) Trends in world military expenditure, 2020\\n  - [2](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2022-04/fs_2204_milex_2021_0.pdf) Trends in World Military Expenditure, 2021\\n  - [3](https://eda.europa.eu/news-and-events/news/2022/12/08/european-defence-spending-surpasses-200-billion-for-first-time-driven-by-record-defence-investments-in-2021) European defence spending surpasses €200 billion for first time'}, {'explanation': 'The article implies that German leaders are being manipulated by the United States, questioning their autonomy and decision-making capabilities.', 'location': 'Of course, it's worth remembering that Germany's political class has long functioned under the watchful eye of Washington.

After the war, the US played a crucial role in the reconstruction of West Germany through initiatives like the Marshall Plan, which provided economic aid to rebuild European economies and prevent the spread of communism [3], [5]. The US also had a significant military presence in Germany during the Cold War, which contributed to the political alignment of West Germany with the Western bloc [4], [6]. In contemporary times, Germany and the US are close allies, cooperating on various global issues, although there are occasional political disagreements [1], [2].\\n- **Warning:** The statement that the US \"micromanages\" Germany\\'s political class is an exaggeration and can be misleading. While the US has historically influenced Germany, especially during the Cold War, Germany is a sovereign nation with its own political processes and decision-making structures. The statement overlooks Germany\\'s agency and the complex nature of international relations, where influence is often mutual and multifaceted.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced substantial increases in defense spending and a commitment to make the German military a central pillar of European defense [1], [2], [4].
