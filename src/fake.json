The debate over whether Western leaders promised not to expand NATO eastward is contentious. Some documents and statements from the early 1990s suggest that there were discussions about limiting NATO's expansion, but there is no formal treaty or written agreement that explicitly prohibits NATO's eastward expansion.\n\n- **Misinformation Explanation:** The statement implies a clear and binding promise was made to the Soviet Union, which is not supported by formal agreements. The assurances were more informal and part of diplomatic discussions rather than legally binding commitments. The lack of a formal agreement means that NATO's expansion does not technically violate any treaty.\n\n- **Warning:** Misunderstanding the nature of these assurances can lead to misconceptions about international agreements and the legitimacy of NATO's actions. It can also fuel geopolitical tensions by suggesting that NATO has acted in bad faith.\n\n- **Sources:** \n  - [NATO's official history](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_49212.htm)\n  - [Brookings Institution analysis](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2014/11/06/was-nato-expansion-a-mistake/)\n  - [The National Security Archive](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/russia-programs/2017-12-12/nato-expansion-what-yeltsin-heard)"

This perspective gained attention during the Ukraine crisis, where NATO's support for Ukraine was seen by some as a factor in escalating the conflict.\n\n- **Misinformation Explanation:** The statement can be misleading if it oversimplifies the complex geopolitical dynamics at play. While NATO's actions may be one factor in European security issues, attributing sole responsibility to NATO ignores other significant factors, such as Russia's actions, historical tensions, and the internal politics of European countries.\n\n- **Warning:** Misleading statements about NATO's responsibility can skew public perception and policy discussions, potentially leading to biased or uninformed decisions regarding international relations and security policies.\n\n- **Sources:** \n  - [NATO and European Security](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_52060.htm)\n  - [The Guardian on NATO and Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/nato-russia-ukraine-crisis)\n  - [BBC Analysis on NATO's Role](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56720589)"
